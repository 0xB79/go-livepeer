[Livepeer](https://livepeer.org) is a decentralized live streaming broadcast platform.  On the Livepeer network, video transcoding and delivery happens in a peer-to-peer fashion, and participants who contribute to the network will be compensated via a crypto token called the Livepeer Token.

Building and running this node allows you to:

* Create a local Livepeer Network, or join the existing Livepeer POC network.
* Broadcast a live stream into the network.
* Request that your stream be transcoded into multiple formats.
* Consume a live stream from the network.
